The AK-47, or AK as it is officially known (also known as the Kalashnikov) is a selective-fire (semi-automatic and automatic), gas-operated 7.62×39 mm assault rifle, developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is officially known in the Soviet documentation as Avtomat Kalashnikova. Design work on the AK-47 began in the last year of World War II (1945). In 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials, and in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the Soviet Army. An early development of the design was the AKS (S—Skladnoy or "folding"), which was equipped with an underfolding metal shoulder stock. In the spring of 1949, the AK-47 was officially accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces and used by the majority of the member states of the Warsaw Pact. Even after almost seven decades, the model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of their substantial reliability under harsh conditions, low production costs compared to contemporary Western weapons, availability in virtually every geographic region and ease of use. The AK-47 has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces worldwide, and was the basis for developing many other types of individual and crew-served firearms. As of 2004, "Of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s"

AK-47 este o pusca de asalt creata in 1947 de Mihail Kalasnikov si folosita in timpul Razboiului Rece (1949) ca arma standard de armatele statelor din Blocul Estic si ale tarilor aliate cu acesta. AK-47, cea mai populara pusca de asalt din lume, are costuri foarte mici si se intretine foarte usor, fiind optima pentru razboiul de gherila. Dupa mai multe modernizari, AK-47 a fost adoptata la scara larga de Armata Rosie, iar in timpul Razboiului Rece a fost produsa in fabrica de armament IJMAS, (abrevierea denumirii Ijevski Maszavod) din Ijevsk, care construia si autovehicule, indeosebi motocicletele IJ. Spre deosebire de principalul concurent pe piata internationala de armament, pusca americana M16, automatul „Kalasnikov” este usor de demontat si ramane functional chiar si dupa ce e scufundat in apa ori ingropat in nisip. Aceste avantaje tehnice s-au dovedit decisive in timpul razboiului din Vietnam si i-au sporit popularitatea. Oficial, intre 70 si 100 de milioane de exemplare au fost fabricate pana acum in intreaga lume, AK-47 fiind cea mai raspandita arma de foc din lume.

The M16 rifle, officially designated Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16, is a United States military adaptation of the Armalite AR-15 rifle. The original M16 was a select-fire, 5.56×45mm rifle with a 20-round magazine. In 1964, the M16 entered American military service and the following year was deployed for jungle warfare operations during the Vietnam War. In 1969, the M16A1 replaced the M14 rifle to become the U.S. military's standard service rifle. The M16A1 improvements include a bolt-assist, chrome plated bore and a new 30-round magazine. In 1983, the USMC adopted the M16A2 rifle and the U.S. Army adopted it in 1986. The M16A2 fires the improved 5.56×45mm NATO (M855/SS109) cartridge and has a new adjustable rear sight, case deflector, heavy barrel, improved handguard, pistol grip and buttstock, as well as a semi-auto and three-round burst only fire selector. Adopted in 1998, the M16A4 is the fourth generation of the M16 series. It is equipped with a removable carrying handle and Picatinny rail for mounting optics and other ancillary devices. The M16 has also been widely adopted by other militaries around the world. Total worldwide production of M16s has been approximately 8 million, making it the most-produced firearm of its 5.56 mm caliber. The U.S. Army has largely replaced the M16 in combat units with the shorter and lighter M4 carbine in 2010, and the U.S. Marine Corps approved a similar change in October 2015.

M16 (nume oficial: Pusca, Calibrul 5.56mm, M16) este denumirea militara americana a automatului AR-15. Compania Colt a achizitionat drepturile pentru pusca de asalt AR-15 de la firma ArmaLite si foloseste aceasta denumire doar pentru versiunile semiautomate. Pusca de asalt M16 foloseste munitie de calibrul 5,56x45 mm care poate produce rani adanci si soc hidrostatic in momentul impactului. Din cauza vitezei mari a cartusului si a rotirii acestuia in organism, tesutul uman este fragmentat, fiind realizat un transfer rapid de energie prin interactiune mecanica. Pusca de asalt M16 a fost folosita de armata Statelor Unite ale Americii in timpul luptelor de jungla din Vietnamul de Sud incepand cu anul 1964. Pana in 1969, M16 a devenit principala arma de foc folosita de trupele americane din Razboiul din Vietnam, inlocuind pusca M14. Armata americana a folosit in continuare pusca M14 pe teritoriul SUA, in Europa si in Coreea de Sud, pana in anul 1970. Inca din timpul Razboiului din Vietnam, seria de arme M16 (M16A1, M16A2, M16A3, M16A14) a devenit pusca standard a armatei americane. Impreuna cu variantele sale, a fost folosita de 15 tari NATO si este cea mai produsa arma de foc care foloseste acest calibru, aproximativ 8 milioane de arme fabricate pana in prezent in intreaga lume. Modelul M16 a fost inlocuit de carabina M4 din anul 2010.

"Little Boy" was the codename for the atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 during World War II by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., commander of the 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces. It was the first atomic bomb to be used in warfare. The Hiroshima bombing was the second artificial nuclear explosion in history, after the Trinity test, and the first uranium-based detonation. It exploded with an energy of approximately 15 kilotons of TNT (63 TJ). The bomb caused significant destruction to the city of Hiroshima. Little Boy was developed by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group of Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. Parsons flew on the Hiroshima mission as weaponeer. The Little Boy was a development of the unsuccessful Thin Man nuclear bomb. Like Thin Man, it was a gun-type fission weapon, but derived its explosive power from the nuclear fission of uranium-235. This was accomplished by shooting a hollow cylinder of enriched uranium (the "bullet") onto a solid cylinder of the same material (the "target") by means of a charge of nitrocellulose propellant powder. It contained 64 kg (141 lb) of enriched uranium, of which less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission. Its components were fabricated at three different plants so that no one would have a copy of the complete design. After the war ended, it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed, but by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect, so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base. The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 for use by the Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft (which could be launched from but not land on the Midway-class aircraft carriers). All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951 with the total of 36 Little Boy bombs.

Little Boy ("Baietelul") a fost numele de cod al primei bombe atomice utilizata intr-un conflict armat, care a lovit in dimineata zilei de 6 august 1945, orasul japonez Hiroshima. Bomba a fost lansata de un bombardier B-29 Superfortress pilotat de Colonelul Paul Tibbets de la baza aeriana 393d Bomb Squadron, Missouri Statele Unite. Little Boy a fost rodul Proiectului Manhattan, un program american ambitios care inca din 1939 urmarea dezvoltare primei arme nucleare. Proiectul a fost demarat ca un raspuns la zvonurile, cum ca germanii lucreaza la o bomba atomica. In urma atacului japonezilor din 1942 asupra flotei americane aflata la baza navala Pearl Harbour si implicarea Americii in Al Doilea Razboi Mondial, Statele Unite ale Americii impreuna cu aliatii sai Regatul Unit si Canada au accelerat demersurile de creare a bombei. Era o bomba cu incarcatura de uraniu 235 (aproximativ 64 kg), prin bombardarea cu neutroni lenti avea loc o reactie nucleara in lant, generator de caldura, cu un efect devastator. Dezvoltarea primelor prototipuri si experimente au fost facute la inceputul anului 1943, imediat dupa deschiderea Laboratorului National Los Alamos, parte componenta a Proiectului Manhattan. Initial bomba era de tip „pistol”, ulterior, in aprilie 1944, s-a descoperit ca fisiunile spontane ale uraniului puteau fi folosite mai eficient in alte tipuri de bombe. Chiar si dupa ce s-a sfarsit razboiul, au fost construite mai multe bombe Little Boy si s-a ajuns la totalul de 36 de bombe construite de acest tip.

"Fat Man" was the codename for the atomic bomb that was detonated over the Japanese city of Nagasaki by the United States on 9 August 1945. It was the second of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare, the first being Little Boy, and its detonation marked the third-ever man-made nuclear explosion in history. It was built by scientists and engineers at Los Alamos Laboratory using plutonium from the Hanford Site and dropped from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bockscar. For the Fat Man mission, Bockscar was piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney. The name Fat Man refers generically to the early design of the bomb, because it had a wide, round shape. It was also known as the Mark III. Fat Man was an implosion-type nuclear weapon with a solid plutonium core. The first of that type to be detonated was the Gadget, in the Trinity nuclear test, less than a month earlier on 16 July at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range in New Mexico. Two more Fat Man bombs were detonated during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946. Some 120 Fat Man units were produced between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.

Fat Man (din engleza: Grasul sau Grasunul) este numele de cod precum si porecla bombei atomice, cunoscuta ca si Marca a III-a, ce a fost detonata deasupra orasului Nagasaki, Japonia, de catre Statele Unite ale Americii la 9 august 1945, la 22:47 ora locala. Era a doua bomba atomica folosita impotriva Japoniei dupa Little Boy, detonata cu trei zile inainte deasupra orasului Hirosima, la 6 august. Aceste 2 bombe au dus la capitularea neconditionata a Japoniei, aliatul Germaniei naziste, in cel de-al Doilea Razboi Mondial - la 15 august 1945. Fat Man cantarea 4.600 kg, avea o lungime de 3,2 metri si un diametru de 1,5 metri, precum si o putere de explozie de 21 de kilotone TNT (aproximativ 42 milioane de batoane de dinamita) si in total au fost construite 120 bombe de acest tip. Cu toate ca bomba a avut o deviatie de aproximativ 2 km, a fost distrus mai mult de jumatate din oras. Populatia orasului Nagasaki a scazut astfel intr-o sutime de secunda de la 422.000 la 383.000 de locuitori: 39.000 de oameni au fost omorati pe loc, iar peste 25.000 au fost raniti.

Tsar Bomba was the Western nickname for the Soviet RDS-220 hydrogen bomb (code name Ivan or Vanya), the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated. Its test on October 30, 1961 remains the most powerful human-made explosion in history. It was also referred to as Kuzkina mat, possibly referring to Nikita Khrushchev's promise to show the United States a Kuzkina mat (an idiom roughly translating to "We'll show you!") at a 1960 session of United Nations General Assembly. Developed by the Soviet Union, the bomb had a yield of approximately 50 megaton TNT (210 PJ). In theory, the bomb had a maximum yield of 100 megatons if it were to have included a U-238 tamper, but because only one bomb was built, this was never demonstrated. The single bomb was detonated at the Sukhoy Nos cape of Severny Island, part of Novaya Zemlya. The remaining bomb casings are located at the Russian Atomic Weapon Museum in Sarov and the Museum of Nuclear Weapons, All-Russian Research Institute of Technical Physics, at Snezhinsk.

Bomba tarului este numele dat de Occident celei mai puternice arme nucleare construita si detonata vreodata. A fost o bomba cu hidrogen in 3 stadii, fabricata de Uniunea Sovietica sub numele oficial de RDS-220, numele de cod fiind Ivan. Proiectul initial prevedea o putere echivalenta de 100 megatone TNT, redusa mai apoi la 50 megatone, pentru limitarea contaminarii radioactive. A fost detonata la 30 octombrie 1961, in arhipelagul Novaia Zemlia. Scopul ei a fost doar demonstrarea capacitatii tehnologiilor militare ale URSS; s-a construit un singur exemplar, cea detonata, iar o macheta se afla in prezent la Muzeul armelor nucleare rusesti din Sarov. Bomba a avut masa de 27 tone, si era de forma unui cilindru lung de 8 m avand diametrul de 2,1 m. Este una din cele mai „curate” bombe atomice create vreodata, 97% din energia ei fiind data de reactia de fuziune nucleara (care nu produce reziduuri radioactive).

The T-34 was a Soviet medium tank that had a profound and lasting effect on the field of tank design. Although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war, it has often been credited as the most effective, efficient and influential tank design of the Second World War. At its introduction, the T-34 possessed an unprecedented combination of firepower, mobility, protection and ruggedness. Its 76.2 mm (3 in) high-velocity tank gun provided a substantial increase in firepower over any of its contemporaries; its heavy sloped armour was difficult to penetrate by most contemporary anti-tank weapons. When first encountered in 1941, the German tank general von Kleist called it "the finest tank in the world" and Heinz Guderian confirmed the T-34's "vast superiority" over existing German armour of the period. The T-34 was the mainstay of Soviet armoured forces throughout the Second World War. Its design allowed it to be continuously refined to meet the constantly evolving needs of the Eastern Front: as the war went on it became more capable, but also quicker and cheaper to produce. Soviet industry would eventually produce over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded as the war progressed despite the loss of thousands in combat against the German Wehrmacht. Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second-most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/55 series). Its evolutionary development led directly to the T-54/55 series of tanks, and from there to the T-62, T-72, and T-90 tanks that, along with several Chinese tanks based on the T-55, form the backbone of many armies even today. T-34 variants were widely exported after World War II and as late as 1996 were still in service in at least 27 countries.
__;__
T-34 a fost un tanc mediu fabricat in Uniunea Sovietica din 1940 pana in 1958. Prima data a fost produs la uzina KhPZ din Harkov, R. S. S. Ucraineana. A fost principalul tanc de lupta al Armatei Rosii in timpul celui de-al Doilea Razboi Mondial. A ramas in istorie ca fiind al doilea tanc ca productie din istorie, dupa succesorul sau din seria T-54/55. A fost exportat masiv, aflandu-se inca in inventarul unor armate din lume. T-34 a fost dezvoltat din seria de tancuri rapide BT si trebuia sa le inlocuiasca pe acestea si pe tancul usor T-26 pe campul de lupta. Cand a fost introdus prima data in dotarea armatei, era cel mai echilibrat tanc din punct de vedere al armamentului, mobilitatii, blindajului si fiabilitatii. Cu toate acestea, eficacitatea sa in primele lupte era redusa din cauza numarului relativ mic de tancuri disponibile, ergonomiei, lipsei acute de echipament radio si tacticii gresite. Turela fusese proiectata pentru 2 persoane, iar comandantul tancului se ocupa si de armament. Designul si constructia tancului au suferit numeroase modificari in timpul razboiului pentru a permite cresterea eficacitatii si a productiei. La inceputul anului 1944, modelul T-34/85 a fost introdus in dotarea trupelor de pe front. Avand o turela imbunatatita (pentru 3 persoane) si un tun de calibrul 85 mm, T-34 a inlocuit multe dintre tancurile usoare si grele, devenind principalul tanc de lupta al Armatei Rosii. Succesorul sau este tancul T-44 care a fost produs aproape pana la sfarsitul celui de-al Doilea Razboi Mondial, fiind urmat de seria T-54/55, care a fost fabricat pana in 1981.

The M4 Sherman, officially Medium Tank, M4, was the most numerous battle tank used by the United States and some of the other Western Allies in World War II. The M4 Sherman proved to be reliable, relatively cheap to produce and available in great numbers. Thousands were distributed through the Lend-Lease program to the British Commonwealth and Soviet Union. The tank was named by the British for the American Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman. The M4 Sherman evolved from the interim M3 Medium Tank, which had its main armament in a side sponson mount. The M4 retained much of the previous mechanical design, but put the main 75 mm gun in a fully traversing turret. One feature, a one-axis gyrostabilizer, was not precise enough to allow firing when moving but did help keep the reticle on target, so that when the tank did stop to fire, the gun would be aimed in roughly the right direction. The designers stressed mechanical reliability, ease of production and maintenance, durability, standardization of parts and ammunition in a limited number of variants, and moderate size and weight. These factors, combined with the Sherman's then-superior armor and armament, outclassed German light and medium tanks of 1939–42. The M4 went on to be produced in large numbers. It spearheaded many offensives by the Western Allies after 1942. When the M4 tank went into combat in North Africa with the British Army at El Alamein in the autumn of 1942, it increased the advantage of Allied armor over German armor and was superior to the lighter German long-barrel 50 mm-gunned Panzer III and the short-barrel 75 mm-gunned Panzer IV then in service. For this reason, the US Army believed that the M4 would be adequate to win the war, and no pressure was exerted for further tank development. Logistical and transport restrictions, such as limitations imposed by roads, ports, and bridges, also complicated the introduction of a more capable but heavier tank. Tank destroyer battalions using vehicles built on the M4 hull and chassis, but with open-topped turrets and more potent high-velocity guns, also entered widespread use in the Allied armies. Even by 1944, most M4 Shermans kept their dual purpose 75 mm M3. By 1944, the M4 was inferior to German heavy tanks, but was able to fight on with mutual support from numerical superiority and with support from growing numbers of fighter-bombers and artillery pieces. The relative ease of production allowed huge numbers of the M4 to be manufactured, and significant investment in tank recovery and repair units allowed disabled vehicles to be repaired and returned to service. These factors combined to give the Allies numerical superiority in most battles, and many infantry divisions were provided with M4s and tank destroyers. A M4A3E8 variant was introduced, with improved suspension and a high-velocity 76 mm gun as used on the tank destroyers. After World War II, the Sherman, often in updated versions, saw combat in many conflicts, including the Korean War, the Arab-Israeli Wars, and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.

M4 Sherman a fost principalul tanc de lupta folosit de catre armata americana in timpul celui de-al Doilea Razboi Mondial. Tancul a fost folosit si de catre aliatii SUA, inclusiv Regatul Unit si URSS, fiind livrat prin sistemul lend-lease (Legea de imprumut si inchiriere). Denumirea oficiala a acestui vehicul era Medium Tank M4 (tancul mediu tip M4). In Marea Britanie, tancul M4 a fost denumit dupa generalul unionist William Tecumseh Sherman, fiind cunoscut obiceiul britanicilor de a denumi tancurile de fabricatie americana in uz dupa generali faimosi din timpul Razboiul civil din America. Soldatii americani au preluat si ei aceasta denumire. In timpul celui de-al Doilea Razboi Mondial, aproximativ 19.247 Sherman au fost livrate armatei SUA si 1.104 Corpului de Infanterie Marina al SUA. SUA a livrat 17.184 exemplare Marii Britanii (o parte din acestea au fost trimise catre canadieni si fortele poloneze libere care luptau alaturi de Aliati), Uniunea Sovietica a primit 4.102 tancuri, si aproximativ 812 au fost trimise spre China. Din aceste tancuri, unele au fost expediate tarilor aliate acestor natiuni. Corpul Infanteriei Marine SUA a folosit variantele M4A2 diesel si M4A3 benzina in Pacific. Totusi, seful Trupelor Blindate ale Armatei, generalul-locotenent Jacob L. Devers, a ordonat ca nici un Sherman diesel sa nu fie folosit inafara Zonei de Interior (America continentala). Armata americana a folosit toate tipurile existente atat pentru teste, cat si pentru instructie, in SUA, dar a intentionat ca variantele M4A2 si M4A4 sa fie destinate in principal exporturilor din Acordul Lend-Lease.

Yamato was the lead ship of the Yamato class of Imperial Japanese Navy World War II battleships. She and her sister ship, Musashi, were the heaviest battleships ever constructed, displacing 72,800 tonnes at full load and armed with nine 46 cm (18.1 inch) 45 Caliber Type 94 main guns, which were the largest guns ever mounted on a warship. Neither ship survived the war. Named after the ancient Japanese Yamato Province, Yamato was designed to counter the numerically superior battleship fleet of the United States, Japan's main rival in the Pacific. She was laid down in 1937 and formally commissioned a week after the Pearl Harbor attack in late 1941. Throughout 1942, she served as the flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet, and in June 1942 Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto directed the fleet from her bridge during the Battle of Midway, a disastrous defeat for Japan. Musashi took over as the Combined Fleet flagship in early 1943, and Yamato spent the rest of the year, and much of 1944, moving between the major Japanese naval bases of Truk and Kure in response to American threats. Although present at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, she played no part in the battle. The only time Yamato fired her main guns at enemy surface targets was in October 1944, when she was sent to engage American forces invading the Philippines during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. On the verge of success, the Japanese force turned back, believing they were engaging an entire US carrier fleet rather than the light escort carrier group that was all that stood between the battleship and the vulnerable troop transports. During 1944, the balance of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much depleted and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In a desperate attempt to slow the Allied advance, Yamato was dispatched on a one-way mission to Okinawa in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.

Vasul de razboi japonez Yamato, numit dupa antica provincie japoneza Yamato, a fost un vas de razboi din clasa Yamato care au servit Marina Imperiala Japoneza in timpul celui de-Al Doilea Razboi Mondial. Ea si nava sora a ei, Musashi, au fost navele de lupta cele mai grele si mai puternic inarmate construite vreodata, cu un deplasament de 72.800 de tone la sarcina maxima si inarmate cu noua tunuri principale de 46 cm. Dar nici cu toate acestea, acest vas nu au supravietuit razboiului. Comandandu-se in mod oficial dupa o saptamana dupa atacul de la Pearl Harbor la sfarsitul anului 1941, Yamato a fost conceput pentru a contracara numeric superioara si vasta flota de vase de lupta din Statele Unite, principalul rival al Japoniei din Pacific. De-a lungul anului 1942 ea a servit drept nava amiral a Flotei Combinate Japoneze, si in iunie 1942 amiralul Isoroku Yamamoto indeparta flota de la conducerea ei in timpul dezastruoasei Batalii de la Midway. Musashi a preluat functia de nava amiral a Flotei Combinate la inceputul anului 1943, si Yamato si-a petrecut restul de ani si o mare parte din 1944 circuland catre bazele navale majore japoneze din Truk si Kure, ca raspuns la amenintarile americane. Desi ea a fost prezenta la Batalia din Marea Filipinelor in iunie 1944, Yamato nu a jucat nici-un rol in lupta. Singura data cand ea a tras cu tunurile ei principale in tintele teritoriului inamic a fost in octombrie 1944, cand a fost trimisa sa atace fortele americane invadatoare Filipine in timpul Bataliei din Golful Leyte. In anul 1944 echilibrul de forte navale din Pacific s-a intors decisiv impotriva Japoniei si, pana la inceputul anului 1945, flota japoneza a fost mult mai saracita si amenintata de lipsa combustibilului in insulele de japoneze, limitand posibilitatea de miscare a flotei. In aprilie 1945, intr-o incercare disperata de a incetini inaintarea aliata, Yamato a fost trimis intr-o calatorie cu sens unic la Okinawa , unde i s-a ordonat sa apere insula de invazia americane si sa lupte pana la distrugere. Deplasarea sa a fost deranjata si incetinita la sud de insula Kyushu de submarine si avioane americane, si la 7 aprilie a fost atacata si scufundata de bombardiere si bombardiere torpiloare cu pierderea celor mai multi dintre membrii echipajului ei.

The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United States Air Force (USAF). The result of the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter program, the aircraft was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter, but also has ground attack, electronic warfare, and signal intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22's airframe and weapons systems and did its final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems. The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. After a protracted development and despite operational issues, the USAF considers the F-22 critical to its tactical air power, and says that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter. The Raptor's combination of stealth, aerodynamic performance, and situational awareness gives the aircraft unprecedented air combat capabilities. The high cost of the aircraft, a lack of clear air-to-air missions due to delays in Russian and Chinese fighter programs, a ban on exports, and development of the more versatile F-35 led to the end of F-22 production. A final procurement tally of 187 operational production aircraft was established in 2009, and the last F-22 was delivered to the USAF in 2012.

F-22 Raptor produs de Lockheed Martin/Boeing este un avion de vanatoare cu un singur loc, face parte din generatia a cincea de avioane militare care dispun de supermanevrabilitate si tehnologie stealth. A fost proiectat in primul rand ca un avion de vanatoare cu superioritate aeriana, dar are si alte capabilitati aditionale cum ar fi atacuri la sol, tehnici de lupta folosind arme eletronice si rolul de interceptare a semnalelor inamice. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics este principalul contractor si este responsabil pentru marea parte din fuzelaj, pentru sistemele de armament si pentru asamblarea finala a lui F-22 Raptor. Partenerul de program Boeing Defense, Space & Security a furnizat aripile, fuzelajul de la pupa, integrarea echipamentelor de zbor si control, si toate sistemele de antrenare a pilotilor si a sistemelor de mentenanta. Aeronava a fost denumita F-22 si F/A-22 in anii de dinaintea intrarii in serviciul F.A. USA in decembrie 2005 cand a fost redenumit ca F-22A. In ciuda unei perioade de dezvoltare prelungite si costisitoare, Fortele Aeriene ale Statelor Unite ale Americii considera ca F-22 este o componenta critica pentru viitorul puterii aeriene tactice a Statelor Unite, si marturiseste ca aeronava nu are rival in comparatie cu alte avioane de vanatoare existente sau in constructie, in timp ce Lockheed Martin afirma ca pentru F-22 Raptor combinatia de tehnologie stealth, viteza, agilitate, precizie si constientizarea situatiei in colaborare cu abilitatile de lupta aer-aer si aer-sol, il fac sa fie cel mai bun avion de vanatoare la modul general din lume in prezent. Angus Houston, seful Fortei de Aparare din Australia, a spus in 2004 ca „F-22 va fi cel mai impresionant avion de vanatoare construit vreodata.” Costul ridicat al aeronavei, lipsa unor misiuni de lupta aer-aer din cauza intarzierii programelor avioanelor de vanatoare din generatia a cincea de fabricatie ruseasca si chineza, o interzicere a exporturilor de F-22 Raptor din partea Statelor Unite ale Americii, si dezvoltarea continua a unor avioane militare de tip F-35, mai versatile si mai ieftine au dus la incheierea productiei de F-22 Raptor. In aprilie 2009, Departamentul de Aparare al Statelor Unite ale Americii au propus incetarea plasarii de noi comenzi, subiect supus aprobarii Congresului, pentru un numar final de 187 de F-22 Raptor produse. Pentru anul fiscal 2010 a fost semnat in octombrie 2009, Actul de Autorizatie a Apararii Nationale, unde productia pentru F-22 Raptor a fost incetata.
